# Case Study
Saudi Digital Academy (SDA) is starting a new Bootcamp in software development for Low Code, they need a website to collect applicant data for the screening process, the collected data are personal information like name, address, phone number, and educational background. The screening is done by the admission team and managers are expected to have a dashboard to have a high-level overview of the admission status, and information like how many applicants? average age? top 10 educational backgrounds, etc. There are a few conditions for a candidate to be qualified to join the Bootcamp, a candidate cannot be currently working, a candidate cannot be studying, and a candidate cannot be enrolled in any other ongoing boot camps. Once a candidate has passed all the selection criteria, an email notification gets sent for an interviewing process. In case a candidate was not qualified then a rejection email gets sent. 



The team at SDA is tasked to create a website to fulfill the requirements of the above scenario, the team to work on this task consists of 3 members, 2 project managers with no coding knowledge, and 1 teaching assistant with coding knowledge. The deadline for project delivery is 3 days. The team is choosing between Low Code and Traditional Development approaches and wants your analysis to decide. Please fill in the below table on the assumption that the website will be developed using each approach so the team can decide what best fits their situation!

|Property|Low Code Development|Traditional Development|
|:---| :---: | :---: |
|**Project Brief**|developing software applications using a graphical user interface| developing software applications using manual coding|
|**Tools**|Rapid application development tools such as *Mendix* and *PEGA*|Web frameworks and programming languages|
|**Coding Knowledge**|Minimum/basic coding knowledge required|advanced coding skills and knowledge|
|**Speed of Development**|rapid development in just 1-3 weeks|may take 2-8 months|
|**Customization**|very limited customization|can be tailored to meet your specific requirements|
|**Agility**|more agile because you can make changes quickly|changes can be slow, But it can be agile|
|**Deployment**|fast But limited platforms,  Depending on the low code tools you are using|free to deploy to any and all platforms|
|**Quality**| - Integrability is limited - Scalability is limited - Performance and speed is standard - With live debugging, the app is error-free| - Integrable with all systems - High scalability - Performance and speed is extremely high - Testing and debugging requires time|
|**Maintenance**|||
